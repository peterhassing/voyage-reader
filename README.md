An attempt to read and decode the rs485 communications spit out by the "voyage one" unit that came with a Weichai wp4

I recently installed a Weichai wp4c120-18 in my ship to power the bow-thruster.
This engine came with a "Voyage one" which spits out a data stream over rs485 to a "Voyage two" which receives and displays this data.
As this "Voyage two" is not very aesthetically pleasing and there is an industruino at hand (to control throttle and pump servos) I took up the project of making a remote dashboard.
This repo holds the code and info I collect along the way, maybe it can be usefull for someone else too...
